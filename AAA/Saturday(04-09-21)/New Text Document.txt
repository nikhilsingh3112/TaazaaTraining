Proxy Object:-

Proxy is a structural design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, caching, etc.) and then passes the request to a service object.



Type of constructor:-
Default, private, static, parameterize constructor
their is one more constructor called copy constructor
copy constructor  is a mechanism to assign data from one object to another object...



conclusion:-
[8:35 PM, 9/4/2021] Gurpreet Taazaa: if we assign one object to another object it means first object is giving address to another object this is major security issue why i give  address of my object to some rather that i should give value of my object to another object.

copy constructor is a technique or a mechanism not to give address of one object to another object (newly object)  rather than i should give value of one object to another object (newly object) this mechanism is called copy constructor and shallow copy.........
