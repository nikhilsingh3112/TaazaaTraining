Remark
  *Controller is unstructured due to not applied proper attribute routing, route prefix, route constraint
  *There is no model Validation(Data Annotation or Fluent Model Validation)

  There is lack of joining because atleast you need to have two tables for relationship.  Give proper demonstration (One to One) or (One to many).
  **Do write Asynchronous programming by implementing task async and await.
  
  Security:
  ****Controller is insecure that is there is no authentication so we need to write logic for securing the controller using Custom middleware.
  *Need to handle runtime exceptions using try  throw and catch.
