When we design the application in core web api we should have some logical thoughts,,, the reason is project is nothing, it is a collection of modules like a bank,, eg home loan
personal loan, daily expenses etc..
We should have expertise to work on home module. 
Things will be repeated for next module.

We have to have a person who can examine the knowledge like generics, collections, eception handling.. 
these are the major areas is to be applied in infrastructure or data access layer.  

Similarly, domain plays a major role because entities , fluentapi, fluentmode Validations and Relations too(O-M,  O-O,  M-M).
These comes under domain layer.
